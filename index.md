**Section:** A07 Evaluation Strategies for Next-Generation AI Systems 
**Mentors:** Rajeev Chhajer, Ryan Lingo 

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The topic of evaluating LLMs and AI to improve performance even though it is a non deterministic task is a really interesting challenge I am excited to tackle.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

I would potentially like to investigate creating different evaluationmethods that can be applied to different types of common agents easily. 

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

We haven't done too much coding yet, so to do more coding.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I would like to try and see if RAG could be implemented in our project somehow.
